# Resistor

## The electronic Resistor Calculator (4-Band) determines the value (in Ohms) and tolerance of a resistor with 4 color configurable bands

### Band 1: Tens digit corresponding to color
### Band 2: Ones digit corresponding to color
### Multiplier (Band 3): The value produced by the first two bands is multiplied by the number corresponsing to this band's color
### Tolerance (Band 4): The largest expected deviance from the value, expressed as Â±%, corresponding to this band's color
